	abstract = {Embryonic stem ({ES}) cells are distinguished by their ability to undergo unlimited self-renewal although retaining pluripotency, the capacity to specify cells of all germ layers. Alternative splicing contributes to these biological processes by vastly increasing the protein coding repertoire, enabling genes to code for novel variants that may confer different biological functions. The homeodomain transcription factor Nanog acts collaboratively with core factors Oct4 and Sox2 to govern the maintenance of pluripotency. We have discovered that Nanog is regulated by alternative splicing. Two novel exons and six subexons have been identified that extend the known Nanog gene structure and protein coding capacity. Alternative splicing results in two novel Nanog protein variants with attenuated capacities for self-renewal and pluripotency in {ES} cells. Our previous results have implicated the C-terminal domain, including the tryptophan-rich ({WR}) domain of Nanog, to be important for the function of Nanog (Wang, J., Levasseur, D. N., and Orkin, S. H. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 6326–6331). Using point mutation analyses, serine 2 (Ser-2) of Nanog has been identified as critical for {ES} cell self-renewal and for stabilizing a pluripotent gene signature. An inducible conditional knock-out was created to test the ability of new Nanog variants to genetically complement Nanog null {ES} cells. These results reveal for the first time an expanded Nanog protein coding capacity. We further reveal that a short region of the N-terminal domain and a single phosphorylatable Ser-2 is essential for the maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency, demonstrating that this region of the protein is highly regulated.},

Although core pluripotency factors are well-characterized, additional regulators, including Otx2, recently have been shown to function during the transition from naive to primed pluripotency. Here we uncover a role for Otx2 in the control of the naive pluripotent state. We analyzed Otx2-binding activity in {ESCs} and {EpiSCs} and identified Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 as direct targets. To unravel the Otx2 transcriptional network, we targeted the strongest Otx2-binding site in the Nanog promoter, finding that this site modulates the size of specific {ESC}-subtype compartments in cultured cells and promotes Nanog expression in vivo, predisposing {ICM} differentiation to epiblast. Otx2-mediated Nanog regulation thus contributes to the integrity of the {ESC} state and cell lineage specification in preimplantation development.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In addition to its role in {DNA} repair and cell cycle progression, Rad51 contributes to the reprogramming process during the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells. In light of this, we performed reprogramming experiments to examine the effect of co-expression of Rad51 and four reprogramming factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc, on the reprogramming efficiency. Co-expression of Rad51 significantly increased the numbers of alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies and embryonic stem cell-like colonies during the process of reprogramming. Co-expression {ofRad}51 significantly increased the expression of epithelial markers at an early stage of reprogramming compared with control cells. Phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX), which initiates the {DNA} double-strand break repair system, was highly accumulated in reprogramming intermediates upon co-expression of Rad51. This study identified a novel role of Rad51 in enhancing the reprogramming efficiency, possibly by facilitating mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and by regulating a {DNA} damage repair pathway during the early phase of the reprogramming process.},

Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data.

	abstract = {{RNA}-sequencing has become the gold standard for whole-transcriptome gene expression quantification. Multiple algorithms have been developed to derive gene counts from sequencing reads. While a number of benchmarking studies have been conducted, the question remains how individual methods perform at accurately quantifying gene expression levels from {RNA}-sequencing reads. We performed an independent benchmarking study using {RNA}-sequencing data from the well established {MAQCA} and {MAQCB} reference samples. {RNA}-sequencing reads were processed using five workflows (Tophat-{HTSeq}, Tophat-Cufflinks, {STAR}-{HTSeq}, Kallisto and Salmon) and resulting gene expression measurements were compared to expression data generated by wet-lab validated {qPCR} assays for all protein coding genes. All methods showed high gene expression correlations with {qPCR} data. When comparing gene expression fold changes between {MAQCA} and {MAQCB} samples, about 85\% of the genes showed consistent results between {RNA}-sequencing and {qPCR} data. Of note, each method revealed a small but specific gene set with inconsistent expression measurements. A significant proportion of these method-specific inconsistent genes were reproducibly identified in independent datasets. These genes were typically smaller, had fewer exons, and were lower expressed compared to genes with consistent expression measurements. We propose that careful validation is warranted when evaluating {RNA}-seq based expression profiles for this specific gene set.},

Clustering analysis of the transcriptomes of 66 cells demonstrated that initially they are non-distinguishable. Early in the segregation, lineage-specific marker expression exhibited no apparent correlation, and a hierarchical relationship was established only in the late blastocyst. Fgf4 exhibited a bimodal expression at the earliest stage analysed, and in its absence, the differentiation of {PrE} and {EPI} was halted, indicating that Fgf4 drives, and is required for, {ICM} lineage segregation. These data lead us to propose a model where stochastic cell-to-cell expression heterogeneity followed by signal reinforcement underlies {ICM} lineage segregation by antagonistically separating equivalent cells.},

Recently, single-cell {RNA}-sequencing has facilitated expression profiling of large numbers of single cells in parallel. To fully exploit these data, it is critical that suitable computational approaches are developed. One key challenge, especially pertinent when considering dividing populations of cells, is to understand the cell-cycle stage of each captured cell. Here we describe and compare five established supervised machine learning methods and a custom-built predictor for allocating cells to their cell-cycle stage on the basis of their transcriptome. In particular, we assess the impact of different normalisation strategies and the usage of prior knowledge on the predictive power of the classifiers. We tested the methods on previously published datasets and found that a {PCA}-based approach and the custom predictor performed best. Moreover, our analysis shows that the performance depends strongly on normalisation and the usage of prior knowledge. Only by leveraging prior knowledge in form of cell-cycle annotated genes and by preprocessing the data using a rank-based normalisation, is it possible to robustly capture the transcriptional cell-cycle signature across different cell types, organisms and experimental protocols.},

Specification of an embryonic cell lineage is driven by a network of interactions among genes encoding transcription factors. Here, we present the gene regulatory network ({GRN}) that directs the specification of the skeletogenic micromere lineage of the sea urchin embryo. The {GRN} now includes all regulatory genes expressed in this lineage up to late blastula stage, as identified in a genomewide survey. The architecture of the {GRN} was established by a large-scale perturbation analysis in which the expression of each gene in the {GRN} was cut off by use of morpholinos, and the effects on all other genes were measured quantitatively. Several cis-regulatory analyses provided additional evidence. The explanatory power of the {GRN} suffices to provide a causal explanation for all observable developmental functions of the micromere lineage during the specification period. These functions are: (i) initial acquisition of identity through transcriptional interpretation of localized maternal cues; (ii) activation of specific regulatory genes by use of a double negative gate; (iii) dynamic stabilization of the regulatory state by activation of a feedback subcircuit; (iv) exclusion of alternative regulatory states; (v) presentation of a signal required by the micromeres themselves and of two different signals required for development of adjacent endomesodermal lineages; and (vi) lineage-specific activation of batteries of skeletogenic genes. The {GRN} precisely predicts gene expression responses and provides a coherent explanation of the biology of specification.},

	abstract = {Summary
The mouse inner cell mass ({ICM}) segregates into the epiblast and primitive endoderm ({PrE}) lineages coincident with implantation of the embryo. The epiblast subsequently undergoes considerable expansion of cell numbers prior to gastrulation. To investigate underlying regulatory principles, we performed systematic single-cell {RNA} sequencing (seq) of conceptuses from E3.5 to E6.5. The epiblast shows reactivation and subsequent inactivation of the X chromosome, with Zfp57 expression associated with reactivation and inactivation together with other candidate regulators. At E6.5, the transition from epiblast to primitive streak is linked with decreased expression of polycomb subunits, suggesting a key regulatory role. Notably, our analyses suggest elevated transcriptional noise at E3.5 and within the non-committed epiblast at E6.5, coinciding with exit from pluripotency. By contrast, E6.5 primitive streak cells became highly synchronized and exhibit a shortened G1 cell-cycle phase, consistent with accelerated proliferation. Our study systematically charts transcriptional noise and uncovers molecular processes associated with early lineage decisions.},

Here, we present experimental observations using quantitative immunofluorescence that pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells ({mESCs}) is established by specific ratios between Oct4 and Nanog. When cells are grown in 2i conditions, they exhibit uniform levels of pluripotency and this is associated with a high correlation between the levels of Oct4 and Nanog in individual cells. The correlation is lost when cells differentiate. Our results suggest that the correlation between these two factors and the distribution of Oct4/Nanog ratios can be used as quantifiers to distinguish between three subpopulations in an {mESC} culture: pluripotent, lineage?primed, and differentiating cells. When we apply these quantifiers to cells with lower levels of Nanog or mutant for ??Catenin or Tcf3, the results suggest that these cells exhibit higher probability of differentiation. {STEM} {CELLS} 2012;30:2683?2691},

Mouse embryonic stem ({ES}) cells are locked into self-renewal by shielding from inductive cues. Release from this ground state in minimal conditions offers a system for delineating developmental progression from naïve pluripotency. Here, we examine the initial transition process. The {ES} cell population behaves asynchronously. We therefore exploited a short-half-life Rex1::{GFP} reporter to isolate cells either side of exit from naïve status. Extinction of {ES} cell identity in single cells is acute. It occurs only after near-complete elimination of naïve pluripotency factors, but precedes appearance of lineage specification markers. Cells newly departed from the {ES} cell state display features of early post-implantation epiblast and are distinct from primed epiblast. They also exhibit a genome-wide increase in {DNA} methylation, intermediate between early and late epiblast. These findings are consistent with the proposition that naïve cells transition to a distinct formative phase of pluripotency preparatory to lineage priming.},

	abstract = {Summary
Embryonic stem cell ({ESC}) self-renewal efficiency is determined by the level of Nanog expression. However, the mechanisms by which Nanog functions remain unclear, and in particular, direct Nanog target genes are uncharacterized. Here we investigate {ESCs} expressing different Nanog levels and Nanog−/− cells with distinct functionally inducible Nanog proteins to identify Nanog-responsive genes. Surprisingly, these constitute a minor fraction of genes that Nanog binds. Prominent among Nanog-reponsive genes is Estrogen-related receptor b (Esrrb). Nanog binds directly to Esrrb, enhances binding of {RNAPolII}, and stimulates Esrrb transcription. Overexpression of Esrrb in {ESCs} maintains cytokine-independent self-renewal and pluripotency. Remarkably, this activity is retained in Nanog−/− {ESCs}. Moreover, Esrrb can reprogram Nanog−/− {EpiSCs} and can rescue stalled reprogramming in Nanog−/− pre-{iPSCs}. Finally, Esrrb deletion abolishes the defining ability of Nanog to confer {LIF}-independent {ESC} self-renewal. These findings are consistent with the functional placement of Esrrb downstream of Nanog.},

Deletion of Nanog causes early embryonic lethality2, whereas constitutive expression enables autonomous self-renewal of embryonic stem cells1. Nanog is accordingly considered a core element of the pluripotent transcriptional network3,4,5,6,7. However, here we report that Nanog fluctuates in mouse embryonic stem cells. Transient downregulation of Nanog appears to predispose cells towards differentiation but does not mark commitment. By genetic deletion we show that, although they are prone to differentiate, embryonic stem cells can self-renew indefinitely in the permanent absence of Nanog. Expanded Nanog null cells colonize embryonic germ layers and exhibit multilineage differentiation both in fetal and adult chimaeras. Although they are also recruited to the germ line, primordial germ cells lacking Nanog fail to mature on reaching the genital ridge. This defect is rescued by repair of the mutant allele. Thus Nanog is dispensible for expression of somatic pluripotency but is specifically required for formation of germ cells. Nanog therefore acts primarily in construction of inner cell mass and germ cell states rather than in the housekeeping machinery of pluripotency. We surmise that Nanog stabilizes embryonic stem cells in culture by resisting or reversing alternative gene expression states.},

This high-resolution binding map is then used to systematically define the context of {POU} factor binding, and reveals patterns of cooperativity and competition in the pluripotency network. The most prominent pattern is a pervasive binding competition between {POU}5F1 and the forkhead transcription factors. Like many transcription factors, {POU}5F1 is co-expressed with a paralog, {POU}2F1, that shares an apparently identical binding specificity. By analyzing thousands of binding measurements, we discover context effects that discriminate {POU}2F1 from {POU}5F1 binding. Proximal {NANOG} binding promotes {POU}5F1 binding, whereas nearby {SOX}2 binding favors {POU}2F1.

Transcription factors ({TFs}) and their specific interactions with targets are crucial for specifying gene-expression programs. To gain insights into the transcriptional regulatory networks in embryonic stem ({ES}) cells, we use chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with ultra-high-throughput {DNA} sequencing ({ChIP}-seq) to map the locations of 13 sequence-specific {TFs} (Nanog, Oct4, {STAT}3, Smad1, Sox2, Zfx, c-Myc, n-Myc, Klf4, Esrrb, Tcfcp2l1, E2f1, and {CTCF}) and 2 transcription regulators (p300 and Suz12). These factors are known to play different roles in {ES}-cell biology as components of the {LIF} and {BMP} signaling pathways, self-renewal regulators, and key reprogramming factors. Our study provides insights into the integration of the signaling pathways into the {ES}-cell-specific transcription circuitries. Intriguingly, we find specific genomic regions extensively targeted by different {TFs}. Collectively, the comprehensive mapping of {TF}-binding sites identifies important features of the transcriptional regulatory networks that define {ES}-cell identity.},

Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation paired-end ditags method, we mapped the binding sites of these factors in the mouse {ES} cell genome. We identified 1,083 and 3,006 high-confidence binding sites for Oct4 and Nanog, respectively. Comparative location analyses indicated that Oct4 and Nanog overlap substantially in their targets, and they are bound to genes in different configurations. Using de novo motif discovery algorithms, we defined the cis-acting elements mediating their respective binding to genomic sites. By integrating {RNA} interference–mediated depletion of Oct4 and Nanog with microarray expression profiling, we demonstrated that these factors can activate or suppress transcription. We further showed that common core downstream targets are important to keep {ES} cells from differentiating. The emerging picture is one in which Oct4 and Nanog control a cascade of pathways that are intricately connected to govern pluripotency, self-renewal, genome surveillance and cell fate determination.},

	abstract = {Embryonic stem ({ES}) cell self‐renewal efficiency is determined by the Nanog protein level. However, the protein partners of Nanog that function to direct self‐renewal are unclear. Here, we identify a Nanog interactome of over 130 proteins including transcription factors, chromatin modifying complexes, phosphorylation and ubiquitination enzymes, basal transcriptional machinery members, and {RNA} processing factors. Sox2 was identified as a robust interacting partner of Nanog. The purified Nanog–Sox2 complex identified a {DNA} recognition sequence present in multiple overlapping Nanog/Sox2 {ChIP}‐Seq data sets. The Nanog tryptophan repeat region is necessary and sufficient for interaction with Sox2, with tryptophan residues required. In Sox2, tyrosine to alanine mutations within a triple‐repeat motif (S X T/S Y) abrogates the Nanog–Sox2 interaction, alters expression of genes associated with the Nanog‐Sox2 cognate sequence, and reduces the ability of Sox2 to rescue {ES} cell differentiation induced by endogenous Sox2 deletion. Substitution of the tyrosines with phenylalanine rescues both the Sox2–Nanog interaction and efficient self‐renewal. These results suggest that aromatic stacking of Nanog tryptophans and Sox2 tyrosines mediates an interaction central to {ES} cell self‐renewal.},

This event has historically been difficult to study due to the fact that it occurs within the maternal tissue and therefore is hidden from view. In this review, we discuss how the mouse embryo is prepared for implantation and the molecular mechanisms involved in directing and coordinating this crucial event. Prior to implantation, the cells of the embryo are specified as precursors of future embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages. These preimplantation cell fate decisions rely on a combination of factors including cell polarity, position and cell–cell signalling and are influenced by the heterogeneity between early embryo cells. At the point of implantation, signalling events between the embryo and mother, and between the embryonic and extraembryonic compartments of the embryo itself, orchestrate a total reorganization of the embryo, coupled with a burst of cell proliferation. New developments in embryo culture and imaging techniques have recently revealed the growth and morphogenesis of the embryo at the time of implantation, leading to a new model for the blastocyst to egg cylinder transition. In this model, pluripotent cells that will give rise to the fetus self-organize into a polarized three-dimensional rosette-like structure that initiates egg cylinder formation.},

We demonstrate here that genomic redistribution of Oct4 by alternative partnering with Sox2 and Sox17 is a fundamental regulatory event of endodermal specification. We show that Sox17 partners with Oct4 and binds to a unique ‘compressed’ Sox/Oct motif that earmarks endodermal genes. This is in contrast to the pluripotent state where Oct4 selectively partners with Sox2 at ‘canonical’ binding sites. The distinct selection of binding sites by alternative Sox/Oct partnering is underscored by our demonstration that rationally point‐mutated Sox17 partners with Oct4 on pluripotency genes earmarked by the canonical Sox/Oct motif. In an endodermal differentiation assay, we demonstrate that the compressed motif is required for proper expression of endodermal genes. Evidently, Oct4 drives alternative developmental programs by switching Sox partners that affects enhancer selection, leading to either an endodermal or pluripotent cell fate. This work provides insights in understanding cell fate transcriptional regulation by highlighting the direct link between the {DNA} sequence of an enhancer and a developmental outcome.

Specification of an embryonic cell lineage is driven by a network of interactions among genes encoding transcription factors. Here, we present the gene regulatory network ({GRN}) that directs the specification of the skeletogenic micromere lineage of the sea urchin embryo. The {GRN} now includes all regulatory genes expressed in this lineage up to late blastula stage, as identified in a genomewide survey. The architecture of the {GRN} was established by a large-scale perturbation analysis in which the expression of each gene in the {GRN} was cut off by use of morpholinos, and the effects on all other genes were measured quantitatively. Several cis-regulatory analyses provided additional evidence. The explanatory power of the {GRN} suffices to provide a causal explanation for all observable developmental functions of the micromere lineage during the specification period. These functions are: (i) initial acquisition of identity through transcriptional interpretation of localized maternal cues; (ii) activation of specific regulatory genes by use of a double negative gate; (iii) dynamic stabilization of the regulatory state by activation of a feedback subcircuit; (iv) exclusion of alternative regulatory states; (v) presentation of a signal required by the micromeres themselves and of two different signals required for development of adjacent endomesodermal lineages; and (vi) lineage-specific activation of batteries of skeletogenic genes. The {GRN} precisely predicts gene expression responses and provides a coherent explanation of the biology of specification.},

Understanding pluripotency at the molecular level should illuminate fundamental properties of stem cells and the process of cellular reprogramming. Through cell fusion the embryonic cell phenotype can be imposed on somatic cells, a process promoted by the homeodomain protein Nanog5, which is central to the maintenance of {ES} cell pluripotency6,7. Nanog is thought to function in concert with other factors such as Oct4 (ref. 8) and Sox2 (ref. 9) to establish {ES} cell identity. Here we explore the protein network in which Nanog operates in mouse {ES} cells. Using affinity purification of Nanog under native conditions followed by mass spectrometry, we have identified physically associated proteins. In an iterative fashion we also identified partners of several Nanog-associated proteins (including Oct4), validated the functional relevance of selected newly identified components and constructed a protein interaction network. The network is highly enriched for nuclear factors that are individually critical for maintenance of the {ES} cell state and co-regulated on differentiation. The network is linked to multiple co-repressor pathways and is composed of numerous proteins whose encoding genes are putative direct transcriptional targets of its members. This tight protein network seems to function as a cellular module dedicated to pluripotency.},

	issn = {1934-5909},
	url = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1934590909005761},

	abstract = {Summary
Embryonic stem cell ({ESC}) pluripotency is dependent on an intrinsic gene regulatory network centered on Oct4. Propagation of the pluripotent state is stimulated by the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor ({LIF}) acting through the transcriptional regulator Stat3. Here, we show that this extrinsic stimulus converges with the intrinsic circuitry in Krüppel-factor activation. Oct4 primarily induces Klf2 while {LIF}/Stat3 selectively enhances Klf4 expression. Overexpression of either factor reduces {LIF} dependence, but with quantitative and qualitative differences. Unlike Klf4, Klf2 increases {ESC} clonogenicity, maintains undifferentiated {ESCs} in the genetic absence of Stat3, and confers resistance to {BMP}-induced differentiation. {ESCs} expanded with Klf2 remain capable of contributing to adult chimeras. Postimplantation-embryo-derived {EpiSCs} lack both Klf2 and Klf4 and expression of either can reinstate naive pluripotency. These findings indicate that Oct4 and Stat3 intersect in directing expression of Klf transcriptional regulators with overlapping properties that additively reinforce ground-state {ESC} pluripotency, identity, and self-renewal.},
